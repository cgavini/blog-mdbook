## Git rebase into forked repo

Excerpted from [here](https://medium.com/@topspinj/how-to-git-rebase-into-a-forked-repo-c9f05e821c8a)

1. Add the remote (original repo that you forked) and call it “upstream”

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/goes-here.git
```

2. Fetch all branches of remote upstream

```sh
git fetch upstream
```

3. Rewrite your master with upstream’s master using git rebase.

```sh
git rebase upstream/master
```

4. Push your updates to master. You may need to force the push with “--force”.

```sh
git push origin master --force
```
