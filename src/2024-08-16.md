## `git` compare file in different branches

See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9834689/how-can-i-see-the-differences-between-two-branches)

The syntax is as follows

```
git difftool [| diff] branch1..branch2 -- <path/to/file/file_to_compare>
```

Example:

```sh
git difftool branch1..branch2 -- ./src/myfile.py
```
