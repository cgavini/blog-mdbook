## Evite CSV import 

The CSV has to be in the following format (pasted from reference link below):


 - Column A: First Name (and/or last name, plus any additional guest names if adding families under one contact).
 - Column B: Email address only (can be left blank if adding guests by phone instead).
 - Column C: Phone numbers only (can be left blank if adding guests by email instead).
 - No headers.
 - No special characters or symbols.
 - No additional columns filled in.

Sample:

```csv
Luke Skywalker,,111-111-1111
Han Solo,,999-999-9999
Chewbacca,,111-111-1111
Obi-Wan Kenobi,,222-222-2222
```
