# WDF Driver Generic Architecture

![](2025-07-29-18-39-34.png)

- `IOCTL`s are used to execute commands that the Application needs. Driver implements a list of IOCTLs in a huge switch statement.
- `WdfRequestRetrieveInputBuffer` is used to get handle to the input buffer from the driver source code
- `WdfRequestRetrieveOutputBuffer` is used to get handle to output buffer from driver src. Driver places results of operation into the output buffer.
- `DeviceIoControl` is invoked by the interface library.
- After the call to `DeviceIoControl`, the output buffer is retrieved and returned to the application.
