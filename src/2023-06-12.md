## `pip` installing packages globally

When `pip` inside virtualenv is installing packages globally check the following:


Try checking your bin/pip and bin/activate scripts. In bin/pip, look at the shebang. Is it correct? If not, correct it. Then on line ~42 in your bin/activate, check to see if your virtualenv path is right. It'll look something like this

`VIRTUAL_ENV="/Users/me/path/to/virtual/environment"`

> If that fails, run the virtual environments pip with its full path.
