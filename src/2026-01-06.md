## GitHub Actions Notes

`$GITHUB_ENV` is a GitHub Actions environment file that allows you to set environment variables that persist across steps within a job.

How It Works
When you write to `$GITHUB_ENV`, you're appending to a special file that GitHub Actions reads between steps. Any variables written to this file become available as environment variables in subsequent steps.

```sh
echo "VARIABLE_NAME=value" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```
