See [here](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/blogs/c-getting-the-directory-of-a-running-executable/):

```cs
public static DirectoryInfo GetExecutingDirectory()
{
        var location = new Uri(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().GetName().CodeBase);
        return new FileInfo(location.AbsolutePath).Directory;
}
```
